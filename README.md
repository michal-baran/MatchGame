<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> :pencil: About The Project</h2>
This project is inspired by the real game "Match" made by Top Trumps.

<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<h2 id="overview"> :point_right: Overview</h2>

The game has the form of double-sided board with 25 square fields in 5x5 layout. There is a cube in each square, and each cube consists of 6 walls with symbols (in this particular case, characters from the Harry Potter series).

### The final version of the game should look like this

Version 1.0 is prepared for playing in the console. The boards will look like this:

The game comes with fifteen cards with the same symbols as on the dice.

In general:
- there are 15 symbols/characters
- there are 25 cubes with symbols, where the symbol combination on each cube is unique (there isn't two equal cubes),
- cube walls in total: 150, so maximum number of occurrences for each symbol/character is 10,

<!-- GAME RULES -->
<h2 id="game-rules"> :grey_question: Game rules</h2>

1. At the beginning, players draw two cards with the characters symbols.
2. The game starts: first player pushes cube on the top-left field - the pushed cube is now on the second player side.
3. The second player can choose a symbol from the cube in his hand, and push it into almost any field on the board (except the one, from which cube comes from). The pushed cube lands on the first player side.
4. The first player does the same as the second player in step 3.
5. The game continues until one of the players has a "match".

Goal:
The player who scores 5 points wins.

<!-- Commands -->
<h2 id="commands"> ðŸ’¡ Commands</h2>
There are several commands available throughout the game:

- <b>/help</b> - shows available additional commands,
- <b>/points</b> - prints players points,
- <b>/show</b> - prints actual player board,
- <b>/quit</b> - exits game

<!-- Building -->
<h2 id="building"> ðŸ”¨ Building the project</h2>

We use the Gradle tool to build the project. To build the program, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Gradle installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command line and navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Execute the gradle build command: **gradle-build**. This will build the project and compile the source code.

After following the steps above, you should find the JAR file you created in the build/libs directory. This is the executable file that you can run.

<!-- Running the program -->
<h2 id="running"> ðŸš€ Running the program</h2>
To run the program, perform the following steps:

1. Open a terminal or command line.
2. Navigate to the directory where the JAR file is located (build/libs)
3. Execute the ***java -jar name_file.jar***, where name_file.jar is the name of the JAR file created in the previous step.

After the above steps, the program will be run and the result of the run will be visible in the console.
